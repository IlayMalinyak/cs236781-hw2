**Your answer:**


1.A - the shape of the input is 64X1024. the shape of the output is 64X512. the shape of the Jacobian is therefore 64X512x1024 
<br>
1.B - the jacobian $\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{x}}$ is just the weight matrix. since usually the weight matrix is sparse (many weights are zero because of different regularizations during training), the jacobian is sparse. 
<br>
1.C - using the chain rule we can calculate the Jacobian vector product instead of fully materialize the Jacobian - since the Jacobian $J$ in this case is $W$  and we need to calculate $\delta X = J \delta Y$ we can just multiply the weight matrix with $\delta Y$ to get the result. 
<br>
2.A - now we need to calcualte $\frac{\partial{y}}{\partial{W}}$ we take the derivative of each of the 512 elements $Y_i$ with respect to all 1024X512 elements $W_{ij}$. so for each sample we have 512X1024X512 elements and in total 64X512X1024X512 elements in the full Jacobian. 
<br>
2.B - since each element $Y_i$ is a linear combination of the i'th row of $W$, $\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{W_{j,k}}} = 0$ for $i \neq j$. this means that the Jacobian is sparse and is essentially the gradient of each output elements with respect to the corresponding weight row. 
<br>
2.C - we again don't need to materialize the Jacobian. we can again use the chain rule and multiply the input tensor with $\delta Y$

**Your answer:**


backprop is not the only way to perform decent-based optimization and therefore it is not required in a decent-based training (for example - https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08587). however, the use of chaine-rule, computational graphs and automatic differentiation makes backprop the method that gives the best trade-off of efficiency and accuracy in a scenario of heavy computations and it is the most used optimization method in the field of deep learning
